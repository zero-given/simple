# Token Monitoring System

## Overview
A comprehensive system for monitoring and analyzing token activity on the blockchain. The system consists of three main components working together to provide real-time token analysis and security assessment.

## Architecture

### Monitor Component (Python)
- Monitors blockchain for new token deployments and updates
- Integrates with GoPlus and Honeypot APIs for security analysis
- Processes and validates token data
- Communicates with backend via WebSocket

### Backend Component (NestJS)
- Manages WebSocket connections with monitor and frontend
- Handles data persistence and caching
- Provides API endpoints for token data
- Manages user sessions and authentication

### Frontend Component (Next.js)
- Real-time token monitoring dashboard
- Built with Next.js and plain CSS
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Data Flow
1. Monitor detects token events on blockchain
2. Security analysis performed via external APIs
3. Data sent to backend via WebSocket
4. Backend processes and stores data
5. Frontend receives updates via WebSocket
6. UI updates in real-time with new data

## Frontend Features

### Theme Customization
- Light grey gradient background (`#f8f9fa` to `#e9ecef`)
- Light blue token cards with hover effects
- Consistent color scheme throughout UI
- Responsive typography with system fonts

### Layout Structure
- Header container with title and status bar
- Horizontal filters bar with search and sorting options
- Main content area with token cards
- Performance monitor overlay
- Responsive grid layout for token cards

### UI Components
- Token cards with sectioned data display
  - Basic token information
  - GoPlus security analysis
  - Honeypot detection results
- Live status indicator
- Filter controls (search, sort, security filters)
- Performance monitoring widget

### Visual Elements
- Gradient backgrounds for containers
- Subtle shadows and borders
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Status indicators with color coding

### Animations
- Smooth transitions for hover states
- Loading animations for data fetching
- New token appearance animation
- Performance-optimized transitions

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time FPS tracking
- Memory usage statistics
- Network latency monitoring
- Render performance metrics
